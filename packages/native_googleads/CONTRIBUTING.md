## Style Guide

### Dart/Flutter Code Style

- Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use `flutter format` to format your code
- Keep line length to 80 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Prefer single quotes for strings

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update the README if you change functionality
- Add inline documentation for public APIs

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests

Example test structure:
```dart
group('FeatureName', () {
  test('should do something when condition is met', () {
    // Arrange
    final instance = MyClass();
    
    // Act
    final result = instance.doSomething();
    
    // Assert
    expect(result, expectedValue);
  });
});
```
